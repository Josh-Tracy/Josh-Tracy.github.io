# Who am I?

I'm a US Air Force veteran who spent 6 years on active duty work as an aircraft electrician. I seperated from active duty and joined the Air National Guard in Tampa, FL where I retrained as a Cyber System Operations Tech. 

From there I began my career in IT working on remote communication systems involving COTS routers and switches. I gained the skills to become a IT helpdesk technician at United States Special Operations Command and worked there while studied the art of Networking.

Upon gaining my CCNA I became a Network Administrator for USSOCOM working with the men and women of the US armed forces across the globe. I configured, maintained, and troubleshot DMVPN, EIGRP, OSPF, VLANS, ACLs, DHCP, and many other unique situations pertaining to networking. 

Once I attained my CCNP I became a Network Engineer for USSOCOM working on the innovations teams. Currently this is where I work and I am given the oppurinity to explore and research new technologies. I have gained my AWS Architect Associate certification and am currently working on cloud implementation projects using a variety of technologies. I am working with RedHat Products such as Ansible, RHEL, and Openshift, as well as having the chance to architect a PaaS as part of a DevOps team.
